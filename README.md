## Features

- Extremely Customizable

    - 20 different configuration settings you can change.

- IRL Trading & Scammer detection
    
    - If a IRL trader / scammer is in our system, it will send a message to all servers that person is in!
    
    - You can also configure the bot to ban, kick, or give a role to scammers and IRL traders!
    
- Verification System

    - You can use this bot to verify in other servers, and you will be verified in all servers with the bot!

    - This can be disabled with configuration settings.
